          Shazelle visited a school in Jajja village, established by Gen. Leraseb, to promote and support girlsâ€™ education. The students she connected with shared their experiences and struggles, particularly the challenges of maintaining good grades and coping with the stress of school. Additionally, they discussed the difficulties they faced as girls from families that were often unsupportive of their education, preferring them to work or get married instead.
