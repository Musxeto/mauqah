            Westminster International and served as its president throughout her
            A-levels. She believed it was crucial to represent women and provide
            them with the support system needed to achieve their goals. She
            organized two major campaigns:

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed border-l-4 border-yellow-700 pl-4 italic">
              The <span className="font-bold">White Ribbon Campaign</span> was a
              collaboration with an initiative to raise awareness about{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">domestic abuse against women</span> in
              Pakistan. Despite facing resistance and jokes from some
              individuals, Shazelle overcame these obstacles by involving them
              directly in the project. She and her team conducted a white ribbon
              march with handmade posters around the school and sold White
              Ribbon merchandise provided by the foundation. By the end of the
              campaign, they raised approximately{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">PKR 40,000</span>, which was donated
              to domestic abuse help centers across Pakistan.

              The <span className="font-bold">Pink Ribbon Campaign</span>{" "}
              focused on spreading awareness about{" "}

              platform for women who have suffered from the disease to share
              their stories. The events took place during the first week of
              October and included a school-wide assembly to introduce breast
              cancer awareness and outline the weekâ€™s activities. Pamphlets were
              distributed, healthcare professionals were invited to speak about
              cancer prevention and detection, and everyone was encouraged to
              wear pink. The campaign also featured a fundraising bake sale,
              which raised <span className="font-bold">PKR 82,000</span> for the
              Pink Ribbon Foundation.
