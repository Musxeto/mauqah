              focused on spreading awareness about{" "}

              platform for women who have suffered from the disease to share
              their stories. The events took place during the first week of
              October and included a school-wide assembly to introduce breast
              cancer awareness and outline the weekâ€™s activities. Pamphlets were
              distributed, healthcare professionals were invited to speak about
              cancer prevention and detection, and everyone was encouraged to
              wear pink. The campaign also featured a fundraising bake sale,
              which raised <span className="font-bold">PKR 82,000</span> for the
              Pink Ribbon Foundation.

              Ribbon merchandise provided by the foundation. By the end of the
